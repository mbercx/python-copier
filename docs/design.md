# Design

## Build system

This template uses **[Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/)** as the build backend and project manager.

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"
```

### âœ… Why choose Hatch?

Hatch is a modern, [PEP 517](https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/)-compliant build backend.
Main features:

**Tool consolidation**

Hatch can also manage virtual environments, test runners, and formatters (e.g. `hatch fmt`), reducing reliance on multiple tools.

**[PEP 621](https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/) support**

Clean, declarative configuration in `pyproject.toml`.
Keeping the number of configuration files minimal.

**Integrated versioning**

Instead of hardcoding the version number in `pyproject.toml`, we delegate it to a separate file (`__about__.py`) inside the source tree.
This pattern has a few advantages:

* **Single source of truth**: The version lives inside your package, making it accessible at runtime via `import`.
* **Tool-friendly**: Hatch can automatically read and update this file using `[tool.hatch.version]`, supporting both static and dynamic versioning.
* **Clean packaging**: Keeps `pyproject.toml` minimal, and avoids cluttering the `__init__.py` with metadata.

## Documentation

The user can select which documentation engine they prefer.
Some information on the two options is already provided below, this will be fleshed out more as both frameworks are tested more rigorously.

## MyST Markdown

[MyST Markdown](https://mystmd.org/) is a Markdown-based documentation tool that avoids Sphinx' reStructuredText format while preserving most of its power.
The main reason to use this over [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to test the Jupyter notebook integration, especially the "executable content".
MyST is also easy to integrate with Sphinx, which has a lot of powerful tools, especially for scientific software.

## MkDocs

[MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) is another Markdown-based documentation tool that focusses even more on simplicity.
Some features:

1. Very simple to build and write, not too much faff.
1. Static pages, easy to host.
1. Sleek look, using [Material for MkDocs](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material).

## DevOps

This template includes development automation tools that ensure code quality, consistency, and developer efficiency.

### Pre-commit hooks

We use [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) to run automated checks before each commit.
The configuration is stored in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, and only uses `hatch fmt` in two separate steps:

* `hatch fmt -f`
* `hatch fmt -l`

The steps are separated in first _formatting_ the code, then _linting_ it to check for issues.
